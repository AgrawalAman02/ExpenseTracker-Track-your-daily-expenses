# ExpenseTracker-Track-your-daily-expenses

  - This is a very basic project on django
  - where one can register / login / logout /add expenses etc
  -  we've made this project in a hurry for our Value Added Training Submission
  -  Maybe in futute we'll improve it further with more features

### These are the advancements i'll make in future
  - A better UI /UX , as a software developer i personally think that our project should be as user friendly as it can
    (as user Convience is our top priority) making things effortlessly smooth is our job
      1. I'll change the Login and Register Page UI , also a Home Page where user Can Navigate all the features
      2. After Login / registration , The Welcome Screen can be more visually appealing , better font / better placement of Data
      3. User income  and expenses sorted on the basis of Date + time / Categories.
      4. User can export the data into CSV file and User Can Insert a long description of the Data
      5. Making CRUD operations more optimized and more efficient
